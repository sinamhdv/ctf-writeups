Heap overflow when parsing string literals in a mini spreadsheet application. (The heap overflow is caused becasue the allocation length is calculated using `strlen`, while the copy operation will skip any character it sees after a backslash (including a null byte)). The heap overflow can be used to partially overwrite `IF` condition struct pointers on the heap, and then `IF` formulas can be used to binary search and leak any value in bss. Using the leaks and the heap overflow we can use classic heap exploitation to get RCE by writing into libc GOT.
